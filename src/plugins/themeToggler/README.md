# ThemeToggler

This plugin allows you to toggle your themes via hotkey or once you start a stream.

The default hotkey is F10, but you can set it to whatever you like. Letters and symbols alone are not recommended for obvious reasons. For detailed info, check the "Setting hotkeys" category.

## Potential use cases:

-   Screenshots
-   Hiding that you use client mods (especially when you stream)
-   Or another use case you came up with

You can configure everything this plugin provides in its settings.

## Setting hotkeys

### Fundamentals

If you want to set your custom hotkey, you can type out the name of the key, for example `F10` would be "F10", `#` would be #.

### Modifier keys

If you want to use the keys Ctrl, Alt or Shift in your hotkey, just add them to the according setting, separated by a plus.
Please note that only the Windows key names work. If you're using MacOS, just do a quick lookup or do some trial and error.
For details, check the examples.

### Examples

```
Ctrl+Shift+F10
Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P
F10
```

### Side note

Changing your hotkey does **not** require a reload.
